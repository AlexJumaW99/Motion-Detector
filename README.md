# Motion-Detector
A Computer Vision python program that detects motion using a webcam and records when it began, and when it ended. It then stores these recordings in a csv file.

# The Motion Graph shows what time motion was detected (motion started) and what time it ended
This is important for reference purposes. For example, one could receive a notification when motion is detected by their CCTV. This might not be a cause for alarm as it could just be their pet etc. But they can look at the time stamp from the motion graph and analyze the footage when motion was detected, instead of going through all the footage. It thus makes the process more convenient.
